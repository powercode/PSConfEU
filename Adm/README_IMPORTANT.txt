Master Slides:
==============

Hey Presenter!
Attached you find the conference master slide deck. We ask that you use this slide deck as a template.
We are looking for demo-rich presentations, so please do not use more than a handful of text slides.
Instead, focus on simple-to-follow demos.

The slide deck consists of console and ISE slides.
It is really easy to add fully color-coded PS code to the ISE slide:
1. Enter the code into a real ISE script pane
2. Copy and paste it to an ISE slide
3. Once you do, a toolbox overlay appears inside PowerPoint with options on how to insert the pasted text. Choose "Keep formatting" to preserve color coding.

The slide deck uses the Ubuntu Monospace Font.
The font is part of the package. Unpack it, and install all font files via right-click and "Install".
Make sure you open the PowerPoint AFTER you installed the fonts, or else they use the wrong font.

Materials:
==========

Please make sure you have a ZIP file ready for us by April 19 (the day prior to the conference).
The ZIP file should contain your PowerPoint presentation plus all scripts and other materials you used in your demos.
Please send this ZIP file to me: tobias.weltner@email.de.

It is important for us to receive your materials by April 19 the latest (you can send them earlier of course).
We want to point to your presentations during the keynote, and do be able to, we need to know what you will be talking about.

Equipment:
==========

You are responsible for your own presentation equipment. So please make sure the slides work well on your notebook.
Beamers work in full HD resolution. We require a HDMI output. 
If your computer has a miniport, make sure you bring the appropriate adapters to connect a standard HDMI cable to your machine.
